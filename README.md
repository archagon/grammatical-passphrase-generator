# Grammatical Passphrase Generator

Diceware is a good method for generating memorable passphrases, but it's a lot harder to remember four random words than a nonsense sentence. (Just ask Lewis Carroll!) This project is an attempt to create a more memorable variant of diceware using random sentence generation.

Bulletin:

* The entropy count is possibly wrong at the moment, as it does not take grammar into account. Will have to double-check.
* The words are currently too esoteric. The wordlist will be limited to more commonly-used words.
* The sentences currently all have the same structure. The structure will eventually be randomized.
